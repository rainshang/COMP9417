What should be in the package:
|--ml-latest-small
|  |--ratings.csv
|  |--movies.csv
|  |--...
|--movie_recommender.py
|--README

We pack the 'MovieLens Latest Datasets' small from
https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ and the program will use
the 'ratings.csv' and 'movies.csv' by default.

'movie_recommender.py' is a Python3 script, the calling format is:

Python3 movie_recommender.py [ratings_csv_path] [movies_csv_path]

It is straightforward to get the recommendation as the guiding
of information text printed out.

Particularly, to evaluate our strategy and models, set 'DEBUG' in
'movie_recommender.py'(line6) True to execute the evaluation function.
It will display a MSE bar chart of the result between prediction
of different k-Top training set and testing set.
